# Squad Project ETL/Power BI

Download all the files from github. 
In order to run the notebook without errors you will need to download 'datosgobes.csv' from classroom and put it in the project folder.

"Squad project.pbix" should be opened in Power BI Desktop Version: 2.126.1261.0 64-bit or higher.

"Squad_Query.sql" should be opened with an SQL Editor and file roots inside the query may be changed in order to work properly.

Also, "population_raw.csv" file has been added to classroom. Is is NOT needed to run the notebook but we uploaded it just for additional information.
